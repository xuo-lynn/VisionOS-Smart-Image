# Apple Vision Pro AI Scanner

Created on VisionOS with Swift and Swift UI. 

Open the app and look at an object in front of you. The camera stream will be broken down into individual frames and scanned by Vision ML foundation. The frame with the highest confidence rating will be used and will open a new window displaying the search results and relevant information for the object.
